As Kelisto continues to grow, both as a product and a company, one challenge we are faced with is learning how to refine the Marvel brand identity and apply it cohesively to each of our products.

Anyone working on the Marvel product is encouraged to stay familiar with this styleguide and help ensure that it is kept up-to-date.
